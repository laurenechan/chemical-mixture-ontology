A body of water does not have to be still or contained; Rivers, streams, canals, and other geographical features where water moves from one place to another are also considered bodies of water.

def: "Soil is an environmental material which is primarily composed of minerals, varying proportions of sand, silt, and clay, organic material such as humus, gases, liquids, and a broad range of resident micro- and macroorganisms." [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil]
comment: 'In engineering terms, soil is referred to as regolith, or loose rock material that lies above the 'solid geology'. Soil is commonly referred to as "earth" or "dirt"; technically, the term "dirt" should be restricted to displaced soil.' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil\n\n" The upper limit of soil is the boundary between soil and air, shallow water, live plants, or plant materials that have not begun to decompose. Areas are not considered to have soil if the surface is permanently covered by water too deep (typically more than 2.5 meters) for the growth of rooted plants.\n\nThe lower boundary that separates soil from the nonsoil underneath is most difficult to define. Soil consists of horizons near the Earth's surface that, in contrast to the underlying parent material, have been altered by the interactions of climate, relief, and living organisms over time. Commonly, soil grades at its lower boundary to hard rock or to earthy materials virtually devoid of animals, roots, or other marks of biological activity. For purposes of classification, the lower boundary of soil is arbitrarily set at 200 cm."

comment: This class is distinct from a geometric surface, which is two-dimensional. The idea of "uppermost" may be problematic. Further, the definition of layer (the superclass of surface in rev 133) references surface. This may be another issue. Perhaps this can be made into an inferred class using 'bounding layer of' some material entity, note that 'bounding layer' implies containment, which may not be valid here.

def: "Silt is granular material of a size somewhere between sand and clay whose mineral origin is quartz and feldspar." [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silt]
comment: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ In the Udden-Wentworth scale (due to Krumbein), silt particles range between 0.0039 to 0.0625 mm, larger than clay but smaller than sand particles. ISO 14688 grades silts between 0.002 mm and 0.063 mm. In actuality, silt is chemically distinct from clay, and unlike clay, grains of silt are approximately the same size in all dimensions; furthermore, their size ranges overlap. Clays are formed from thin plate-shaped particles held together by electrostatic forces, so present a cohesion. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture Soil Texture Classification system, the sand-silt distinction is made at the 0.05 mm particle size. The USDA system has been adopted by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). In the Unified Soil Classification System (USCS) and the AASHTO Soil Classification system, the sand-silt distinction is made at the 0.075 mm particle size (i.e., material passing the #200 sieve). Silts and clays are distinguished mechanically by their plasticity.

Approximately 71% of the Earth's surface is covered by ocean, a continuous body of water that is customarily divided into several principal oceans and smaller seas. More than half of this area is over 3,000 metres (9,800 ft) deep. Average oceanic salinity is around 35 parts per thousand (ppt) (3.5%), and nearly all seawater has a salinity in the range of 30 to 38 ppt.

comment: Unlike biomes, ecoregions are geographically defined entities. ENVO's sister project, GAZ, contains terms for instances of ecoregions (e.g. Beringia lowland tundra). Requests for new terms should be directed to GAZ. ENVO will only contain this top-level class. The class' definition is preliminary and will be aligned to BFO.

def: "Ecozones delineate large areas of a planetary surface within which organisms have been evolving in relative isolation over long periods of time, separated from one another by geographic features, such as oceans, broad deserts, or high mountain ranges, that constitute barriers to migration." [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ecozone]
comment: ENVO contains this top-level class, but all instances will be in GAZ. The definition is preliminary and will be aligned to BFO.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/  Ecozones correspond to the floristic kingdoms of botany or zoogeographic regions of zoology. Ecozones are characterized by the evolutionary history of the organisms they contain. They are distinct from biomes, also known as major habitat types, which are divisions of the Earth's surface based on life form, or the adaptation of plants and animals to climatic, soil, and other conditions. Biomes are characterized by similar climax vegetation. Each ecozone may include a number of different biomes. A tropical moist broadleaf forest in Central America, for example, may be similar to one in New Guinea in its vegetation type and structure, climate, soils, etc., but these forests are inhabited by plants and animals with very different evolutionary histories.

Landforms factored into geodiversity metrics typically include folds, faults, and other expressions of morphology or relations between units of earth material. Natural processes that are included in measures of geodiversity are those which either maintain or change materials or geoforms, including tectonics, sediment transport, and pedogenesis.

def: "A material accumulation process during which the mass of snow on a surface increases." [http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4808-4736]
comment: This term is used both as a process and as an amount of mass added. Semantically speaking these are two distinct concepts (e.g., accumulation results in accumulation_amount of ice or snow gain), though accumulation_amount would more likely be an attribute.\n\nThe scope of this term varies depending on the definition.  Some definitions constrain themselves snow or ice added to glaciers; while others also include ice fields, snow cover, and/or floating ice.  How to resolve this depends on the scope desired.\n\nSome definitions include additional discussion of the the physics involved which would be useful for connecting glacier ontologies to atmospheric, hydrologic, etc. ontologies.  This information should be captured no matter how the inconsistencies above are resolved.

comment: This class refers to Earth's weather fronts. Other forms, not composed of air, are present on other planets and can be created on request. Note: "Since the temperature distribution is the most important regulator of atmospheric density, a front almost invariably separates air masses of different temperature. Along with the basic density criterion and the common temperature criterion, many other features may distinguish a front, such as a pressure trough, a change in wind direction, a moisture discontinuity, and certain characteristic cloud and precipitation forms." {xref="http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Front"}

In the case of sexually reproducing organisms, the individuals within a population have the potential to reproduce with one another during the course of their lifetimes. 'Community', as often used to describe a group of humans, is a type of population of organisms. \n\nClasses for population already  exist in IDO ('organism population', IDO_0000509) and OBI ('population', OBI_0000181). The definitions should be standardized across OBO Foundry ontologies and only one term used.

comment: Ecological community is defined broadly here, but includes both ecological interactions (inherited from parent term community) and spatial co-existence. It may be used to describe every organisms living in an area, but is often used to refer only to organisms of a particular taxon or guild (e.g., the plant community, the insect community, the herbivore community). The word community, as it often used to describe a group of humans living together, is a type of single-species collection of organisms, not an ecological community.

Where derives_from links classes of continuants, preceded_by links classes of processes. Clearly, however, these two relations are not independent of each other. Thus if cells of type C1 derive_from cells of type C, then any cell division involving an instance of C1 in a given lineage is preceded_by cellular processes involving an instance of C.    The assertion P preceded_by P1 tells us something about Ps in general: that is, it tells us something about what happened earlier, given what we know about what happened later. Thus it does not provide information pointing in the opposite direction, concerning instances of P1 in general; that is, that each is such as to be succeeded by some instance of P. Note that an assertion to the effect that P preceded_by P1 is rather weak; it tells us little about the relations between the underlying instances in virtue of which the preceded_by relation obtains. Typically we will be interested in stronger relations, for example in the relation immediately_preceded_by, or in relations which combine preceded_by with a condition to the effect that the corresponding instances of P and P1 share participants, or that their participants are connected by relations of derivation, or (as a first step along the road to a treatment of causality) that the one process in some way affects (for example, initiates or regulates) the other." xsd:string

property_value: IAO:0000116 "This branch of the ontology deals with causal relations between entities. It is divided into two branches: causal relations between occurrents/processes, and causal relations between material entities. We take an 'activity flow-centric approach', with the former as primary, and define causal relations between material entities in terms of causal relations between occurrents.\n\nTo define causal relations in an activity-flow type network, we make use of 3 primitives:\n\n * Temporal: how do the intervals of the two occurrents relate? \n * Is the causal relation regulatory?\n * Is the influence positive or negative\n\nThe first of these can be formalized in terms of the Allen Interval Algebra. Informally, the 3 bins we care about are 'direct', 'indirect' or overlapping. Note that all causal relations should be classified under a RO temporal relation (see the branch under 'temporally related to'). Note that all causal relations are temporal, but not all temporal relations are causal. Two occurrents can be related in time without being causally connected. We take causal influence to be primitive, elucidated as being such that has the upstream changed, some qualities of the donwstream would necessarily be modified.\n\nFor the second, we consider a relationship to be regulatory if the system in which the activities occur is capable of altering the relationship to achieve some objective. This could include changing the rate of production of a molecule.\n\nFor the third, we consider the effect of the upstream process on the output(s) of the downstream process. If the level of output is increased, or the rate of production of the output is increased, then the direction is increased. Direction can be positive, negative or neutral or capable of either direction. Two positives in succession yield a positive, two negatives in succession yield a positive, otherwise the default assumption is that the net effect is canceled and the influence is neutral.\n\nEach of these 3 primitives can be composed to yield a cross-product of different relation types." xsd:string
